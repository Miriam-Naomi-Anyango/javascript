//When declaring variables consider the following rules
//A variable cannot be a reserved keyword
//It should be meaningful
//Cannot begin with a number
//A variable cannot contain a space or a hyphen.
//Variables are case sensitive
//if you want to initialize variable with more than two names you can use comas

//For example
let secondName = 'Naomi', thirdName = 'Anyango';
console.log(thirdName);
//In order therefore to have a variable if it has many names
//  use a camel case while combining the names
